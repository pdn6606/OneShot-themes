# OneShot-themes
An attempt to recreate the desktop in OneShot: World Machine Edition in XFCE.  
The icon pack is based from Pixelitos and RetroPixel.  
Some icons are also provided by @Charpurr (on Twitter).  
xfwm4 theme is made by apprehensions (on GitHub).  
## Instruction:
- Put the xfwm4-theme folder to ~/.local/share/themes and rename the folder to OneShot (or whatever you want), then select the theme from the Window Manager settings.
- Put the icon-pack folder to ~/.local/share/icons and rename the folder to OneShot (or something else), then select the icon pack from the Appearances settings.
- Put the gtk.css file to ~/.config/gtk-3.0 (make sure to backup your gtk.css file if it exists) then log out/restart.  
## Notes:
- Some of the icon might be left unchanged. If you want to change them, you can either use alacarte (or your favorite menu editor) or add the icons manually to the icon pack.
- Some of the panel items might go over the border (been trying to fix this but to no avail).
- You may need to adjusts some of the settings for panel and desktop as well, examples like fonts, fonts size and icons size. The fonts used in the preview is Terminus (TTF) Bold, which came along with the pack (you will still need to install it).
